📝 Project Overview
This is a Machine Learning project analyzing the popular Advanced Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to predict house prices by exploring, experimenting, and learning different algorithms.

🔍 What I Did
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data.

Feature Engineering → Created new features, transformed skewed data, and applied encoding. Some changes improved results, others lowered performance—learning from both was part of the process.

Model Training & Evaluation → Tried, tested, and tuned multiple algorithms, including:
Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Voting Regressor, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting

Metrics Used → R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

💡 Key Learning
This project was an opportunity to experiment with a variety of algorithms while learning their strengths, weaknesses, and tuning effects on model performance. It was both challenging and fun to see how small changes could drastically impact the results.
