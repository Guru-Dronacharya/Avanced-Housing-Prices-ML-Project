Project Overview->
This is a Machine Learning project analyzing the popular Advanced Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to predict house prices by exploring, experimenting, and learning different algorithms.

What I Did->
    -EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)- Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data.
    -Feature Engineering- Created new features, transformed skewed data, and applied encoding. Some changes improved results, others lowered performance; learning from both was part of the process.
    -Model Training & Evaluation- Tried, tested, and tuned multiple algorithms, including:
    -Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Voting Regressor, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting
    -Metrics Used- RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Key Learning->
This project was an opportunity to experiment with a variety of algorithms while learning their strengths, weaknesses, and tuning effects on model performance. It was both challenging and fun to see how small changes could drastically impact the results.
