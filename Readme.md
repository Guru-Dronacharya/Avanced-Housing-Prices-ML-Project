Project Overview->
This is a Machine Learning project analyzing the popular Advanced Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to predict house prices by exploring, experimenting, and learning different algorithms.

What I Did->
    -EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)- Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data.
    
    -Feature Engineering- Created new features, transformed skewed data, and applied encoding. Some changes improved results, others lowered performance; learning from both was part of the process.
    -Model Training & Evaluation- Tried, tested, and tuned multiple algorithms, including:
    
    -Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Voting Regressor, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting
    
    -Metrics Used- RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Key Learning->
This project provided an opportunity to experiment with various algorithms, learning their strengths, weaknesses, and the effects of tuning on model performance. It was both challenging and enjoyable to see how small changes could have a drastic impact on the results.

I got the best R2 results with the Gradient Boosting Regressor, R2 Score -> 0.9133, MAE -> 0.1053
